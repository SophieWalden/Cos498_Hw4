A mega-todo list of all of the upgrades that might be made for this engine

Engine:
 - Easily create new factions mid-game
 - Ability to build unit-made structures
  - Research structures which unlock building of advanced units
 - Create topright display of:
  - Factions list
   - units controlled
   - Cities controlled
   - Resources per factions
  - Speed selection
  - Turn count

Terrain:
 - Create wood, stone, and metal tiles which units can build machines on to harvest
  - Enemies can capture these machines? Or destroy them?
  - Wood for basic units, stone for structures, and metal for advanced units

AI:
 - GANN evolutionary AI
 - Basic City Conquering AI
 - Ability to defect after condition
 - Basic army commanding structure for all AI
  - Break down units into three categories: commander, generals, and soldiers
  - Commander establishes missions like "conquer cities" or "defend cities"
  - Generals decide which cities to take their troop 
  - Soldiers follow generals commands and do the individual pathfinding towards towns / cities
  - When a General dies the next eldest soldier is promoted (Maybe a func that takes eldest + amount of kills?)
  - When a commander dies the next general also evaluated is promoted
  - Specifics of pathfinding / action decision making is what separates different AIs


Misc Notes:
 - Map wrapping needs to be accounted for in pathfinding
  - For example, maybe with a 10x10 map maybe routing to [3,8] could also check shortest path to [13, 8], [3, 18], [-7, 8], and [3, -2]?

TODO Order:
 - Make basic conditional decisions that can later be changed across different AI systems
 - Fix lag in planning stage (moving mass units)
 - Create a visual way to discern between ranks / choices (Icons for commander missions, arrows for generals goals?)

List of known bugs:
 - factions can create units in unowned cities
 - Since all factions starting assigning unit ids at 0 then multiple units with the same id cant move in the same turn across factions


Initially to solve the sorting problem I created a sort that randomized command order, but kept each factions relative command order the same
This solved the fairness problem between multiple faction planning
The problem is that while doing all the planning in one tick is fine for static fields it can make animations look choppy
To solve this I spread it out
