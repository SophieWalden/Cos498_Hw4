A mega-todo list of all of the upgrades that might be made for this engine

Engine:
 - Easily create new factions mid-game
 - Ability to build unit-made structures
  - Research structures which unlock building of advanced units
 - Create topright display of:
  - Factions list
   - units controlled
   - Cities controlled
   - Resources per factions
  - Speed selection
  - Turn count

Terrain:
 - Create wood, stone, and metal tiles which units can build machines on to harvest
  - Enemies can capture these machines? Or destroy them?
  - Wood for basic units, stone for structures, and metal for advanced units

AI:
 - GANN evolutionary AI
 - Basic City Conquering AI
 - Ability to defect after condition
 - Basic army commanding structure for all AI
  - Break down units into three categories: commander, generals, and soldiers
  - Commander establishes missions like "conquer cities" or "defend cities"
  - Generals decide which cities to take their troop 
  - Soldiers follow generals commands and do the individual pathfinding towards towns / cities
  - When a General dies the next eldest soldier is promoted (Maybe a func that takes eldest + amount of kills?)
  - When a commander dies the next general also evaluated is promoted
  - Specifics of pathfinding / action decision making is what separates different AIs


Misc Notes:
 - Map wrapping needs to be accounted for in pathfinding
  - For example, maybe with a 10x10 map maybe routing to [3,8] could also check shortest path to [13, 8], [3, 18], [-7, 8], and [3, -2]?

TODO Order:
 - Create basic commander, general, soldier structure
 - Commander decides between conquer and defend
 - Generals choose city
 - Soldiers do pathfinding
 - Create a visual way to discern between ranks / choices (Icons for commander missions, arrows for generals goals?)
 - Make basic conditional decisions that can later be changed across different AI systems

List of known bugs:
 - factions can create units in unowned cities
 - Since all factions starting assigning unit ids at 0 then multiple units with the same id cant move in the same turn across factions
